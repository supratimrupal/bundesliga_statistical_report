Title: Bundesliga Passing Accuracy Analysis Report

------------------------------------------------------
I developed a comprehensive statistical analysis report on the impact of passing accuracy on football match outcomes. 
This project involved analyzing a dataset from the Bundesliga to explore whether a higher passing rate influences a team's chances of winning a game.

The analysis covered two primary questions:

1.     Whether the winning team generally has a higher passing rate than the losing team.
2.     If the difference in passing rates in games with winners differs significantly from those ending in a draw.

To address these questions, I applied various statistical techniques, 
including descriptive analysis, hypothesis testing (one-sample t-test), and non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U Test). 

The findings indicated that winning teams tend to have higher passing accuracy than losing teams, 
while there is no significant difference in passing accuracy between drawn games and games with a winner.

This project was executed using Python and various libraries like NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and SciPy were leveraged 
with a focus on robust data preprocessing, transformation, and visualization to extract meaningful insights.
